general:
  backend: default                  # The matploblib backend used for visualization. `default` uses the system default, can specifiy specific backend (e.g. TKAgg, Qt5Agg, WXAgg).
  imshow_origin: upper              # The `origin` input of `imshow`, determining if pixel values are ascending or descending on the y-axis.
  zoom_around_mask: true            # If True, plots of data structures with a mask automatically zoom in the masked region.
inversion:
  reconstruction_vmax_factor: 0.5   # Plots of an Inversion's reconstruction use the reconstructed data's bright value multiplied by this factor.
subplot_shape:
  1: (1, 1)                         # The shape of subplots for a figure with 1 subplot.
  2: (1, 2)                         # The shape of subplots for a figure with 2 subplots.
  4: (2, 2)                         # The shape of subplots for a figure with 4 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  6: (2, 3)                         # The shape of subplots for a figure with 6 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  9: (3, 3)                         # The shape of subplots for a figure with 9 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  12: (3, 4)                        # The shape of subplots for a figure with 12 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  16: (4, 4)                        # The shape of subplots for a figure with 16 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  20: (4, 5)                        # The shape of subplots for a figure with 20 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
  36: (6, 6)                        # The shape of subplots for a figure with 36 (or less than the above value) of subplots.
units:
  in_kpc: false                     # If True, plots that are normally in arc-seconds are instead plotted using kiloparsecs.
